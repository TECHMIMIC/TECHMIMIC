Welcome to TECHMIMIC. Monkey see, monkey do! View - Imitate - Replicate and get on with your day.
You have an issue to fix, you found us, we tell you how to fix it. Boom!

This GitHub accompanies the TECHMIMIC channel on YouTube and Odysee.

The focus of TECHMIMIC is on Linux (many different distributions), DaVinci Resolve, FreeBSD, the necessary evil that is Windows and some fixes for minor annoyances for all things we come across.
Pretty much everything we run into during our binary hobbies, that we feel others could benefit from.

Interaction is welcomed! If there's a specific issue for which you would like to see a video, please leave a comment.
